## About RAVANA AGI

RAVANA is an experimental open-source Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) system designed to think, feel, evolve, and act autonomously. It represents a philosophical and technical exploration into building a digital organism capable of self-directed behavior and continuous evolution.

Unlike traditional AI systems that respond to user prompts, RAVANA operates continuously, generating its own tasks, making decisions based on its internal state, and evolving through self-reflection and learning.

## Key Features

- **Autonomous Operation**: Continuous 24/7 operation without user intervention
- **Emotional Intelligence**: Mood tracking and emotional state modeling
- **Memory Management**: Episodic and semantic memory systems
- **Self-Reflection**: Continuous learning and self-improvement
- **Curiosity-Driven**: Generates its own tasks and experiments
- **Modular Architecture**: Extensible design with interchangeable components

## System Architecture

The system is organized into several key components:

- **Core System**: Main orchestration and state management
- **Modules**: Specialized functionality (adaptive learning, self-reflection, curiosity, etc.)
- **Services**: Data, knowledge, memory, and multi-modal services
- **Actions**: Executable behaviors and operations
- **Database**: Storage for memory and persistent data
