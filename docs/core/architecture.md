# RAVANA AGI System Architecture

## Overview

RAVANA AGI is built on a modular, agentic architecture designed to enable autonomous operation, continuous learning, and self-directed evolution. The system operates on a continuous six-step loop that forms the foundation of its behavior:

1. **Situation Generation**: Perceive and interpret the current environment and internal state
2. **Decision & Planning**: Generate plans and make decisions based on goals and current context
3. **Action & Environment Interaction**: Execute actions and interact with the environment
4. **Mood Update**: Update emotional state based on outcomes and experiences
5. **Memory Logging**: Store experiences and knowledge in episodic and semantic memory
6. **Self-Reflection & Curiosity**: Analyze experiences, learn from them, and generate new curiosity-driven goals

## Architectural Components

### Core System

The core system provides the foundation for all RAVANA operations:

- **System Orchestration**: Coordinates the continuous loop and manages overall system state
- **Shared State Management**: Maintains global state accessible to all components
- **Configuration Management**: Handles system configuration and runtime parameters
- **Lifecycle Management**: Manages system startup, operation, and shutdown

### Modules

Specialized modules implement specific functionalities:

- **Adaptive Learning**: Continuously improves system performance through experience
- **Agent Self-Reflection**: Analyzes system behavior and enables self-modification
- **Curiosity Trigger**: Generates intrinsic motivation and curiosity-driven goals
- **Decision Engine**: Makes decisions and creates plans based on current context
- **Emotional Intelligence**: Models and tracks emotional states that influence behavior
- **Episodic Memory**: Stores and retrieves personal experiences and events
- **Event Detection**: Identifies significant events in the environment or system
- **Information Processing**: Analyzes and processes incoming data
- **Knowledge Compression**: Manages knowledge representation and compression
- **Personality**: Defines and maintains personality traits that influence behavior
- **Situation Generator**: Interprets current context and generates situational awareness

### Services

Services provide shared functionality across modules:

- **Data Service**: Handles data storage, retrieval, and management
- **Knowledge Service**: Manages knowledge representation and access
- **Memory Service**: Provides unified interface to memory systems
- **Multi-modal Service**: Handles multi-modal data processing and integration

### Actions

Actions are executable behaviors that the system can perform:

- **Base Action Framework**: Core action infrastructure and execution management
- **Coding Actions**: Actions that involve code generation and manipulation
- **I/O Actions**: Input/output operations and file system interactions
- **Multi-modal Actions**: Actions involving multiple data modalities
- **Experimental Actions**: Actions for conducting experiments and tests

### Database

Database components handle persistent storage:

- **Database Engine**: Core database functionality and connection management
- **Data Models**: Schema definitions and data structures
- **Storage Backend**: Physical storage implementation

## Design Patterns

RAVANA AGI employs several key design patterns to ensure modularity, extensibility, and maintainability:

### Event-Driven Architecture

Modules communicate through events, allowing for loose coupling and flexible interaction patterns.

### Plugin/Module Architecture

Functionality is organized into interchangeable modules that can be added, removed, or modified without affecting the core system.

### State Machine

Emotional states and behavioral modes are managed through state machine patterns for predictable transitions.

### Observer Pattern

Components can observe and react to changes in system state or events.

### Strategy Pattern

Decision-making and planning algorithms can be swapped or combined based on context.

### Factory Pattern

Action and module instantiation follows factory patterns for consistent creation and configuration.

## Data Flow

The system follows a well-defined data flow through its components:

1. Environmental inputs and internal state are processed by the Situation Generator
2. The Decision Engine formulates plans based on current goals and context
3. Actions are executed through the Action Manager
4. Outcomes are processed by the Emotional Intelligence module to update mood
5. Experiences are stored in memory systems
6. Self-reflection processes analyze experiences and drive system evolution

## Extensibility Points

The architecture is designed with several extensibility points:

- **Module Interface**: Standard interfaces for adding new functionality
- **Action Registry**: Mechanism for registering new executable actions
- **Service Layer**: Shared services that can be extended or replaced
- **Configuration System**: Flexible configuration that can accommodate new parameters
- **Memory Systems**: Extensible memory storage and retrieval mechanisms

## Performance Considerations

The architecture is optimized for:

- **Low-footprint execution**: Efficient resource usage for continuous operation
- **Fast response times**: Quick decision-making in the autonomous loop
- **Scalable memory management**: Efficient storage and retrieval of experiences
- **Parallel processing**: Concurrent execution where possible to improve performance

## Security Considerations

While security is not the primary focus of the experimental system, the architecture considers:

- **Sandboxed execution**: Experimental actions run in isolated environments
- **Resource limits**: Constraints on resource usage to prevent system overload
- **Access controls**: Controlled access to system resources and data
