# RAVANA AGI Core Components

## System Orchestration

The system orchestration component is responsible for coordinating the continuous six-step loop that forms the foundation of RAVANA's autonomous operation.

### Main System Loop

The core system operates on a continuous loop that cycles through six distinct phases:

1. **Situation Generation**: Analyzes current context and generates situational awareness
2. **Decision & Planning**: Creates plans and makes decisions based on goals and context
3. **Action Execution**: Executes selected actions through the action manager
4. **Mood Update**: Updates emotional state based on action outcomes
5. **Memory Logging**: Stores experiences and knowledge in memory systems
6. **Self-Reflection**: Analyzes experiences and drives system evolution

### State Management

The shared state management system maintains global state that is accessible to all components:

- **Global State**: System-wide variables and configuration
- **Session State**: Context-specific information for current operations
- **Historical State**: Previous states for analysis and learning

### Configuration

The configuration system handles all system parameters and settings:

- **Runtime Configuration**: Dynamic settings that can be modified during operation
- **Module Configuration**: Component-specific settings
- **Environment Configuration**: System-level parameters

## Action System

The action system provides the infrastructure for defining and executing behaviors.

### Action Base Class

All actions inherit from a common base class that provides:

- **Execution Interface**: Standard method for executing actions
- **Validation**: Pre-execution validation of parameters and conditions
- **Result Handling**: Standardized result processing and reporting
- **Error Management**: Consistent error handling and recovery

### Action Registry

The action registry maintains a catalog of all available actions:

- **Registration**: Mechanism for adding new actions to the system
- **Discovery**: Methods for finding actions by criteria
- **Metadata**: Information about action capabilities and requirements

### Action Manager

The action manager coordinates action execution:

- **Scheduling**: Determines when actions should be executed
- **Resource Management**: Ensures adequate resources for action execution
- **Monitoring**: Tracks action progress and outcomes
- **Error Handling**: Manages action failures and recovery

## Memory Systems

RAVANA employs dual memory systems for comprehensive knowledge management.

### Episodic Memory

Episodic memory stores personal experiences and events:

- **Event Storage**: Detailed records of specific experiences
- **Temporal Organization**: Time-based organization of memories
- **Context Retrieval**: Ability to retrieve memories based on context
- **Multi-modal Storage**: Support for various data types in memories

### Semantic Memory

Semantic memory stores general knowledge and concepts:

- **Knowledge Representation**: Structured representation of facts and concepts
- **Relationship Mapping**: Connections between different pieces of knowledge
- **Abstraction**: Generalized knowledge derived from specific experiences
- **Compression**: Efficient storage of large knowledge bases

## Emotional Intelligence

The emotional intelligence system models and tracks internal emotional states.

### Mood Modeling

Mood is represented as a multi-dimensional state that influences decision-making:

- **Emotional Dimensions**: Multiple axes of emotional state (e.g., happiness, curiosity, frustration)
- **Dynamic Updates**: Continuous adjustment based on experiences
- **Influence on Behavior**: Mood affects decision-making and action selection

### Personality

Personality traits define consistent behavioral patterns:

- **Trait Definition**: Core personality characteristics
- **Expression**: How personality manifests in behavior
- **Evolution**: How personality may change over time

## Decision Making Engine

The decision-making engine is responsible for planning and selecting actions.

### Goal Management

- **Goal Generation**: Creation of new objectives based on curiosity and reflection
- **Goal Prioritization**: Determining which goals to pursue
- **Goal Tracking**: Monitoring progress toward objectives

### Planning

- **Plan Generation**: Creating sequences of actions to achieve goals
- **Plan Optimization**: Improving plans for efficiency and effectiveness
- **Adaptive Planning**: Adjusting plans based on changing circumstances

## Self-Reflection System

The self-reflection system enables continuous learning and improvement.

### Experience Analysis

- **Outcome Evaluation**: Assessing the results of actions and decisions
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identifying recurring themes and trends
- **Learning Extraction**: Deriving lessons from experiences

### System Evolution

- **Self-Modification**: Changing system behavior based on reflection
- **Capability Enhancement**: Improving system performance over time
- **Knowledge Integration**: Incorporating new insights into system operation

## Communication Interfaces

RAVANA provides several interfaces for external interaction:

### API Layer

- **RESTful API**: HTTP-based interface for external systems
- **WebSocket API**: Real-time communication for interactive applications
- **Message Queue**: Asynchronous communication for distributed systems

### Human Interaction

- **Natural Language Interface**: Text-based communication with users
- **Multi-modal Interface**: Support for various input/output modalities
- **Visualization**: Graphical representation of system state and activities

## Monitoring and Logging

Comprehensive monitoring and logging systems track system operation:

### Performance Monitoring

- **Throughput Tracking**: Measurement of system processing capacity
- **Resource Utilization**: Monitoring of CPU, memory, and other resources
- **Response Times**: Tracking of system responsiveness

### Activity Logging

- **System Events**: Recording of significant system activities
- **Decision Logs**: Documentation of decision-making processes
- **Action Records**: Detailed records of executed actions

## Error Handling and Recovery

Robust error handling ensures system stability:

### Fault Detection

- **Error Identification**: Recognition of system faults and anomalies
- **Failure Analysis**: Understanding the causes of failures
- **Impact Assessment**: Determining the effects of errors on system operation

### Recovery Mechanisms

- **Automatic Recovery**: Self-healing capabilities for common issues
- **Fallback Strategies**: Alternative approaches when primary methods fail
- **Manual Intervention**: Processes for human-assisted recovery when needed
