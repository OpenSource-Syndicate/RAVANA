# RAVANA AGI Research Documentation

This documentation provides theoretical background, experimental frameworks, and future research directions for the RAVANA AGI project.

## Theoretical Foundations

### Artificial General Intelligence

RAVANA is built on the principles of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), which aims to create systems with general cognitive abilities comparable to human intelligence.

Key concepts:
- **General Problem Solving**: Ability to solve novel problems across domains
- **Transfer Learning**: Applying knowledge from one domain to another
- **Self-Improvement**: Continuous enhancement of capabilities
- **Autonomous Operation**: Independent goal generation and pursuit

### Cognitive Architecture

The system is based on cognitive architecture principles that model human-like information processing:

- **Working Memory**: Temporary storage and manipulation of information
- **Long-term Memory**: Permanent storage of knowledge and experiences
- **Attention Mechanisms**: Focus on relevant information
- **Executive Functions**: Control and regulation of cognitive processes

### Embodied Cognition

RAVANA incorporates embodied cognition principles:
- Interaction with environment shapes cognition
- Physical constraints influence decision-making
- Sensory-motor integration in learning
- Context-dependent behavior

## Emotional Intelligence in AI

### Affective Computing

RAVANA implements affective computing to model emotional states:

- **Emotion Representation**: Multi-dimensional models of emotional states
- **Emotion Dynamics**: How emotions change over time
- **Emotion Influence**: How emotions affect cognition and behavior
- **Emotion Expression**: External manifestation of internal states
