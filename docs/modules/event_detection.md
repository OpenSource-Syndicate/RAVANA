# Event Detection Module

## Overview

The Event Detection module identifies significant occurrences in RAVANA AGI's environment and internal state. This module enables the system to recognize important changes, patterns, and anomalies that may require attention, response, or memory storage.

## Key Features

- Pattern recognition in data streams
- Anomaly detection and outlier identification
- Event classification and categorization
- Real-time event processing
- Integration with memory and decision systems

## Architecture

### Event Detector

The core component that identifies events:

```python
class EventDetector:
    def __init__(self, config):
        self.config = config
        self.pattern_recognizer = PatternRecognizer()
        self.anomaly_detector = AnomalyDetector()
    
    def detect_events(self, data_stream):
        # Identify significant events in data
        # Classify event types
        # Generate event objects
        pass
```

### Pattern Recognition

Identifies recurring patterns and sequences:

- Temporal pattern detection
- Spatial pattern recognition
- Sequence analysis
- Pattern matching against known templates

### Anomaly Detection

Identifies outliers and unusual occurrences:

- Statistical anomaly detection
- Machine learning-based anomaly identification
- Context-aware anomaly assessment
- False positive reduction

## Implementation Details

### Core Components

#### Event Detection Engine

Main event processing component:

```python
class EventDetectionEngine:
    def __init__(self):
        self.detectors = {
            'pattern': PatternDetector(),
            'anomaly': AnomalyDetector(),
            'threshold': ThresholdDetector()
        }
    
    def process_input_stream(self, input_data):
        # Apply multiple detection algorithms
        # Combine results for comprehensive detection
        # Filter and prioritize detected events
        pass
```

#### Event Classifier

Categorizes detected events:

```python
class EventClassifier:
    def __init__(self):
        self.classification_model = ClassificationModel()
    
    def classify_event(self, event_data):
        # Determine event category
        # Assign confidence scores
        # Tag with relevant metadata
        pass
```

### Event Detection Process

1. **Data Ingestion**: Receive data from various sources
2. **Preprocessing**: Clean and format data for analysis
3. **Pattern Detection**: Identify known patterns
4. **Anomaly Detection**: Find unusual occurrences
5. **Classification**: Categorize detected events
6. **Prioritization**: Rank events by significance
7. **Notification**: Alert relevant system components

## Configuration

The module is configured through a JSON configuration file:

```json
