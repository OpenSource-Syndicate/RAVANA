# Emotional Intelligence Module

## Overview

The Emotional Intelligence module models and manages RAVANA AGI's internal emotional states, providing a foundation for mood-influenced decision-making, behavior modulation, and personality expression. This module enables the system to exhibit more human-like responses and maintain consistent behavioral characteristics.

## Key Features

- Multi-dimensional mood tracking and modeling
- Emotional influence on decision-making and behavior
- Personality trait definition and expression
- Affective computing capabilities
- Emotional state persistence and evolution

## Architecture

### Mood Processor

The core component that manages emotional states:

```python
class MoodProcessor:
    def __init__(self, config):
        self.config = config
        self.emotional_dimensions = {}
        self.personality_traits = {}
    
    def update_mood(self, experience_data):
        # Update emotional state based on experiences
        pass
    
    def get_mood_influence(self):
        # Calculate influence of mood on decision-making
        pass
```

### Emotional Dimensions

Multi-dimensional emotional state representation:

- Happiness/Sadness scale
- Curiosity/Boredom scale
- Frustration/Calmness scale
- Confidence/Doubt scale
- Excitement/Apathy scale

### Personality System

Consistent behavioral characteristics:

- Big Five personality traits (OCEAN model)
- Behavior consistency mechanisms
- Personality evolution tracking
- Trait influence on system behavior

## Implementation Details

### Core Components

#### Emotional Intelligence Engine

Main emotional processing component:

```python
class EmotionalIntelligenceEngine:
    def __init__(self):
        self.mood_processor = MoodProcessor()
        self.personality_manager = PersonalityManager()
        self.affective_computer = AffectiveComputer()
    
    def process_emotional_response(self, stimulus):
        # Generate appropriate emotional response
        # Update mood state
        # Apply personality influence
        pass
```

#### Mood Processor

Detailed mood management:

```python
class MoodProcessor:
    def __init__(self):
        self.current_mood = {}
        self.mood_history = []
        self.mood_influencers = {}
    
    def update_from_experience(self, experience, outcome):
        # Adjust mood based on experience outcome
        # Apply temporal decay to emotions
        # Consider personality in mood adjustment
        pass
```

### Emotional Processing Pipeline

1. **Stimulus Detection**: Identify events that may trigger emotional responses
2. **Response Generation**: Create appropriate emotional reactions
3. **Mood Update**: Adjust current emotional state
4. **Personality Integration**: Apply personality influence on emotions
5. **Behavior Modulation**: Influence actions based on emotional state
6. **State Persistence**: Store emotional state for consistency

## Configuration

The module is configured through a JSON configuration file:

```json
