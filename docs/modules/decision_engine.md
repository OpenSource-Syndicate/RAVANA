# Decision Engine Module

## Overview

The Decision Engine module is responsible for RAVANA AGI's planning and decision-making processes. It evaluates goals, generates action plans, and selects optimal behaviors based on current context, system state, and predicted outcomes. This module is central to the system's autonomous operation and goal-directed behavior.

## Key Features

- Goal management and prioritization
- Action planning and sequencing
- Decision optimization based on multiple factors
- Risk assessment and management
- Integration with emotional state and memory systems
- Adaptive decision strategies

## Architecture

### Decision Maker

The core decision-making component evaluates options and makes selections:

```python
class DecisionMaker:
    def __init__(self, config):
        self.config = config
        self.goal_manager = GoalManager()
        self.planner = Planner()
        self.risk_assessor = RiskAssessor()
    
    def make_decision(self, context):
        # Evaluate available actions
        # Consider emotional state
        # Assess risks and outcomes
        # Select optimal action
        pass
```

### Goal Manager

Manages the system's goals and objectives:

- Goal generation from curiosity and reflection
- Goal prioritization based on importance and urgency
- Goal tracking and progress monitoring
- Goal decomposition into sub-goals

### Planner

Creates detailed action plans to achieve goals:

- Action sequencing and scheduling
- Resource allocation planning
- Contingency planning for alternative paths
- Plan optimization and refinement

### Risk Assessor

Evaluates potential risks and uncertainties:

- Outcome probability estimation
- Impact assessment of potential failures
- Risk mitigation strategy development
- Safety constraint evaluation

## Implementation Details

### Core Components

#### Enhanced Decision Maker

Advanced decision-making capabilities:

```python
class EnhancedDecisionMaker:
    def __init__(self):
        self.strategy_selector = StrategySelector()
        self.outcome_predictor = OutcomePredictor()
        self.learning_engine = LearningEngine()
    
    def enhanced_decision_process(self, decision_context):
        # Apply multiple decision strategies
        # Predict outcomes using learned models
        # Adapt based on past decision effectiveness
        pass
```

#### Search Result Manager

Manages external information for decision-making:

```python
class SearchResultManager:
    def __init__(self):
        self.information_integrator = InformationIntegrator()
    
    def integrate_search_results(self, search_data):
        # Process external information
        # Assess reliability and relevance
        # Integrate with decision context
        pass
```

### Decision Process

1. **Context Analysis**: Evaluate current situation and available information
2. **Goal Assessment**: Identify relevant goals and their priorities
3. **Option Generation**: Create possible action sequences
4. **Evaluation**: Assess each option based on multiple criteria
5. **Risk Analysis**: Evaluate potential risks and outcomes
6. **Selection**: Choose optimal action based on evaluation
7. **Execution Planning**: Create detailed execution plan

## Configuration

The module is configured through a JSON configuration file:

```json
{
    "decision_strategy": "adaptive",
    "planning_depth": 5,
    "risk_tolerance": 0.6,
    "goal_priority_weights": {
        "curiosity": 0.3,
        "survival": 0.9,
        "learning": 0.7,
        "social": 0.5
    },
    "optimization_criteria": [
        "efficiency",
        "effectiveness",
        "resource_usage",
        "risk_minimization"
    ]
}
```
