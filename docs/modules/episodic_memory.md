# Episodic Memory Module

## Overview

The Episodic Memory module enables RAVANA AGI to store, retrieve, and utilize personal experiences and events. This module provides the system with the ability to remember specific occurrences, learn from past experiences, and use contextual information for decision-making and behavior modulation.

## Key Features

- Event-based memory storage with rich contextual information
- Temporal organization and retrieval of memories
- Context-sensitive memory recall
- Multi-modal memory support (text, images, audio)
- Integration with semantic memory for knowledge extraction

## Architecture

### Memory Storage

The core memory storage system:

```python
class EpisodicMemory:
    def __init__(self, config):
        self.config = config
        self.memory_store = MemoryStore()
        self.index_manager = IndexManager()
    
    def store_memory(self, experience):
        # Store experience with temporal and contextual metadata
        pass
    
    def retrieve_memory(self, query):
        # Retrieve memories based on query parameters
        pass
```

### Memory Components

#### Event Storage

Detailed records of specific experiences:

- Temporal metadata (timestamp, duration)
- Contextual information (environment, mood, goals)
- Content data (multi-modal experience data)
- Outcome information (results, learning)

#### Temporal Organization

Time-based organization of memories:

- Chronological indexing
- Temporal clustering of related events
- Time-based retrieval optimization
- Memory aging and forgetting mechanisms

#### Context Management

Context-sensitive memory handling:

- Context vector generation
- Context-based retrieval algorithms
- Context similarity measurement
- Cross-context memory linking

## Implementation Details

### Core Components

#### Memory Client

Interface for memory operations:

```python
class MemoryClient:
    def __init__(self):
        self.storage_engine = StorageEngine()
        self.search_engine = SearchEngine()
    
    def create_memory(self, experience_data):
        # Create and store new memory
        # Generate embeddings for content
        # Index for retrieval
        pass
    
    def recall_memory(self, recall_query):
        # Search and retrieve relevant memories
        # Apply context filtering
        # Rank by relevance
        pass
```

#### Embedding Service

Generates vector representations for memory content:

```python
class EmbeddingService:
    def __init__(self):
        self.embedding_model = EmbeddingModel()
    
    def generate_embeddings(self, content):
        # Generate vector embeddings for content
        # Support multiple modalities
        # Batch processing for efficiency
        pass
```

### Memory Processing Pipeline

1. **Experience Encoding**: Convert experiences into memory format
2. **Content Processing**: Generate embeddings and metadata
3. **Storage**: Persist memory with indexing
4. **Consolidation**: Integrate with existing knowledge
5. **Retrieval**: Access memories based on queries
6. **Forgetting**: Remove or compress less relevant memories

## Configuration

The module is configured through a JSON configuration file:

```json
{
    "storage_backend": "chromadb",
    "embedding_model": "openai-text-embedding-ada-002",
    "memory_retention": {
        "short_term_hours": 24,
        "long_term_days": 365,
        "compression_threshold": 1000
    },
    "retrieval_settings": {
        "default_similarity_threshold": 0.7,
        "context_weight": 0.8,
        "temporal_weight": 0.2
    },
    "multi_modal": {
        "text_enabled": true,
        "image_enabled": true,
        "audio_enabled": true
    }
}
```
