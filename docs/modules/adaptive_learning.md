## Implementation Details

### Core Components

#### EnhancedLearningEngine

The enhanced learning engine provides advanced learning capabilities:

```python
class EnhancedLearningEngine:
    def __init__(self, config):
        self.config = config
        self.models = {}
        self.experience_buffer = []
    
    def learn_from_experience(self, experience):
        # Process experience and update models
        pass
    
    def optimize_decision_process(self, context):
        # Optimize decision-making based on learned patterns
        pass
```

#### Experience Storage

Experiences are stored with rich contextual information:

```python
class LearningExperience:
    def __init__(self, action, context, outcome, feedback):
        self.action = action
        self.context = context
        self.outcome = outcome
        self.feedback = feedback
        self.timestamp = datetime.now()
```

### Learning Process

1. **Experience Collection**: Gather data from system operations
2. **Preprocessing**: Clean and format data for learning
3. **Feature Extraction**: Identify relevant features for learning
4. **Model Training**: Update learning models with new data
5. **Evaluation**: Assess model performance and improvements
6. **Deployment**: Apply improved models to system operation
