# Curiosity Trigger Module

## Overview

The Curiosity Trigger module generates intrinsic motivation for RAVANA AGI, driving exploration and learning through the identification of novel, uncertain, or interesting aspects of the environment and internal state. This module is essential for autonomous goal generation and self-directed learning.

## Key Features

- Novelty detection in experiences and information
- Uncertainty identification in knowledge gaps
- Interest area prioritization
- Goal generation based on curiosity
- Integration with decision-making and learning systems

## Architecture

### Curiosity Engine

The core curiosity engine identifies and quantifies curiosity triggers:

```python
class CuriosityEngine:
    def __init__(self, config):
        self.config = config
        self.novelty_detector = NoveltyDetector()
        self.uncertainty_estimator = UncertaintyEstimator()
    
    def assess_curiosity(self, stimulus):
        # Assess curiosity level for a given stimulus
        pass
    
    def generate_goals(self, curiosity_assessment):
        # Generate curiosity-driven goals
        pass
```

### Novelty Detector

Identifies novel patterns and experiences:

- Pattern matching against known experiences
- Anomaly detection in data streams
- Temporal novelty (new over time)
- Contextual novelty (new in context)

### Uncertainty Estimator

Measures knowledge gaps and uncertainties:

- Confidence scoring of existing knowledge
- Information gap identification
- Predictive uncertainty assessment
- Exploration value calculation

### Interest Mapper

Maintains and updates interest areas:

- Interest category tracking
- Interest intensity scoring
- Interest evolution over time
- Cross-domain interest connections

## Implementation Details

### Core Components

#### Curiosity Trigger

The main curiosity trigger component:

```python
class CuriosityTrigger:
    def __init__(self):
        self.novelty_detector = NoveltyDetector()
        self.uncertainty_estimator = UncertaintyEstimator()
        self.interest_mapper = InterestMapper()
    
    def trigger_curiosity(self, input_data):
        novelty_score = self.novelty_detector.detect(input_data)
        uncertainty_score = self.uncertainty_estimator.estimate(input_data)
        interest_score = self.interest_mapper.map(input_data)
        
        # Combine scores to determine overall curiosity
        curiosity_level = self.combine_scores(
            novelty_score, uncertainty_score, interest_score
        )
        
        return curiosity_level
```

#### Goal Generator

Generates goals based on curiosity assessments:

```python
class GoalGenerator:
    def __init__(self):
        self.planning_engine = PlanningEngine()
    
    def generate_curiosity_goals(self, curiosity_triggers):
        # Generate exploration goals
        # Prioritize based on curiosity levels
        # Create action plans for goal pursuit
        pass
```

### Curiosity Assessment Process

1. **Stimulus Detection**: Identify potential curiosity triggers
2. **Novelty Assessment**: Evaluate how novel the stimulus is
3. **Uncertainty Assessment**: Measure knowledge gaps related to stimulus
4. **Interest Mapping**: Determine relevance to existing interests
5. **Curiosity Scoring**: Combine assessments into overall score
6. **Goal Generation**: Create goals for high-curiosity stimuli

## Configuration

The module is configured through a JSON configuration file:

```json
{
    "novelty_threshold": 0.7,
    "uncertainty_threshold": 0.6,
    "interest_decay_rate": 0.01,
    "goal_generation_rate": 10,
    "exploration_balance": 0.8,
    "categories": [
        "technology",
        "science",
        "philosophy",
        "creativity",
        "social_interaction"
    ]
}
```
