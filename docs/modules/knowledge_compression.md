# Knowledge Compression Module

## Overview

The Knowledge Compression module manages efficient knowledge representation and storage within RAVANA AGI. This module enables the system to reduce information redundancy, identify core concepts, and maintain a compact yet comprehensive knowledge base that supports reasoning, learning, and decision-making.

## Key Features

- Knowledge abstraction and summarization
- Redundancy elimination and deduplication
- Efficient storage techniques for large knowledge bases
- Knowledge retrieval optimization
- Integration with semantic memory systems

## Architecture

### Compression Engine

The core component that handles knowledge compression:

```python
class CompressionEngine:
    def __init__(self, config):
        self.config = config
        self.abstraction_engine = AbstractionEngine()
        self.deduplication_manager = DeduplicationManager()
    
    def compress_knowledge(self, knowledge_base):
        # Identify redundant information
        # Abstract core concepts
        # Generate compressed representation
        pass
```

### Abstraction System

Creates higher-level representations of detailed information:

- Concept generalization and categorization
- Hierarchical knowledge organization
- Pattern-based abstraction
- Semantic clustering

### Deduplication Manager

Identifies and eliminates redundant information:

- Similarity detection across knowledge items
- Duplicate identification and removal
- Near-duplicate consolidation
- Version management for evolving knowledge

### Core Components

#### Knowledge Compression Engine

Main compression processing component:

```python
class KnowledgeCompressionEngine:
    def __init__(self):
        self.compression_algorithms = {
            'semantic': SemanticCompression(),
            'structural': StructuralCompression(),
            'temporal': TemporalCompression()
        }
    
    def compress_knowledge_base(self, knowledge_data):
        # Apply multiple compression strategies
        # Combine results for optimal compression
        # Maintain retrieval effectiveness
        pass
```

#### Abstraction Engine

Generates abstract representations:

```python
class AbstractionEngine:
    def __init__(self):
        self.concept_mapper = ConceptMapper()
        self.hierarchy_builder = HierarchyBuilder()
    
    def create_abstractions(self, detailed_knowledge):
        # Identify core concepts
        # Build conceptual hierarchies
        # Generate abstract representations
        pass
```

### Compression Process

1. **Knowledge Analysis**: Examine knowledge base structure and content
2. **Redundancy Detection**: Identify duplicate and similar information
3. **Abstraction Generation**: Create higher-level representations
4. **Compression Application**: Apply compression algorithms
5. **Quality Assessment**: Evaluate compressed knowledge effectiveness
6. **Storage Optimization**: Persist compressed knowledge efficiently
7. **Retrieval Integration**: Ensure effective access to compressed knowledge
