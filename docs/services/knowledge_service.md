# Knowledge Service

## Overview

The Knowledge Service manages structured knowledge representation, storage, and retrieval within RAVANA AGI. This service provides semantic search capabilities, ontology management, and knowledge validation to support the system's reasoning, learning, and decision-making processes.

## Key Features

- Ontology management and maintenance
- Knowledge graph construction and querying
- Semantic search capabilities
- Knowledge validation and consistency checking
- Integration with memory systems

## Architecture

### Knowledge Manager

The core component that orchestrates knowledge operations:

```python
class KnowledgeManager:
    def __init__(self, config):
        self.config = config
        self.ontology_engine = OntologyEngine()
        self.graph_store = GraphStore()
    
    def query_knowledge(self, query):
        # Process semantic queries
        # Search knowledge graph
        # Return structured results
        pass
```

### Ontology Engine

Manages knowledge structure and relationships:

- Ontology definition and maintenance
- Concept hierarchy management
- Relationship mapping and validation
- Semantic consistency checking

### Graph Store

Stores and queries knowledge graphs:

- Node and relationship storage
- Graph traversal algorithms
- Indexing for efficient queries
- Graph visualization support

## Implementation Details

### Core Components

#### Knowledge Service Engine

Main knowledge service component:

```python
class KnowledgeServiceEngine:
    def __init__(self):
        self.semantic_analyzer = SemanticAnalyzer()
        self.query_processor = QueryProcessor()
        self.consistency_checker = ConsistencyChecker()
    
    def process_knowledge_request(self, request):
        # Analyze semantic meaning
        # Process knowledge queries
        # Validate knowledge consistency
        # Return structured results
        pass
```

#### Semantic Analyzer

Processes natural language into semantic representations:

```python
class SemanticAnalyzer:
    def __init__(self):
        self.nlp_engine = NLPEngine()
        self.concept_mapper = ConceptMapper()
    
    def analyze_semantics(self, text):
        # Parse natural language input
        # Extract semantic concepts
        # Map to knowledge graph entities
        # Generate semantic representation
        pass
```

### Knowledge Operations Pipeline

1. **Request Processing**: Parse and validate knowledge requests
2. **Semantic Analysis**: Convert requests to semantic queries
3. **Graph Querying**: Search knowledge graph for relevant information
4. **Result Processing**: Structure and format query results
5. **Validation**: Check consistency and accuracy of results
6. **Response Generation**: Create final knowledge response
7. **Caching**: Store results for future access

## Configuration
