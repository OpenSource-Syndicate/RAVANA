    def __init__(self, config):
        self.config = config
        self.processors = {}
        self.integration_engine = IntegrationEngine()
    
    def process_multimodal_data(self, data):
        # Identify data types
        # Route to appropriate processors
        # Integrate cross-modal information
        # Return processed results
        pass
```

## Implementation Details

### Core Components

#### Multi-modal Service Engine

Main multi-modal service component:

```python
class MultiModalServiceEngine:
    def __init__(self):
        self.media_analyzer = MediaAnalyzer()
        self.cross_modal_integrator = CrossModalIntegrator()
        self.synthesis_engine = SynthesisEngine()
    
    def process_multimodal_request(self, request):
        # Analyze media content
        # Extract relevant features
        # Integrate cross-modal information
        # Generate comprehensive response
        pass
```

#### Media Analyzer

Processes individual media types:

```python
class MediaAnalyzer:
    def __init__(self):
        self.text_analyzer = TextAnalyzer()
        self.image_analyzer = ImageAnalyzer()
        self.audio_analyzer = AudioAnalyzer()
    
    def analyze_media(self, media_data):
        # Identify media type
        # Apply appropriate analysis
        # Extract key features
        # Generate structured representation
        pass
```

### Multi-modal Operations Pipeline

1. **Media Detection**: Identify input media types and formats
2. **Preprocessing**: Convert media to standard formats
3. **Individual Processing**: Apply modality-specific analysis
4. **Feature Extraction**: Extract relevant features from each modality
5. **Cross-modal Integration**: Combine information across modalities
6. **Semantic Alignment**: Create unified semantic representation
7. **Response Generation**: Generate multi-modal output
