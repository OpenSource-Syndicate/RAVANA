# Data Service

## Overview

The Data Service provides standardized access to various data sources and storage mechanisms within RAVANA AGI. This service enables consistent data operations across the system, supporting multiple storage backends and providing a unified interface for data management.

## Key Features

- Unified data access interface
- Multiple storage backend support
- Data transformation capabilities
- Query optimization and caching
- Transaction management and consistency

## Architecture

### Data Manager

The core component that orchestrates data operations:

```python
class DataManager:
    def __init__(self, config):
        self.config = config
        self.backends = {}
        self.cache = CacheManager()
    
    def get_data(self, query):
        # Retrieve data from appropriate backend
        # Apply caching where beneficial
        # Return structured data
        pass
```

### Backend Adapters

Support for different storage systems:

- Relational database adapters (PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite)
- NoSQL database adapters (MongoDB, Cassandra)
- File system storage adapters
- Cloud storage adapters (S3, Google Cloud Storage)

### Cache Manager

Optimizes data access through caching:

- In-memory caching for frequently accessed data
- Query result caching
- Cache invalidation strategies
- Memory usage optimization

## Implementation Details

### Core Components

#### Data Service Engine

Main data service component:

```python
class DataServiceEngine:
    def __init__(self):
        self.connection_manager = ConnectionManager()
        self.query_optimizer = QueryOptimizer()
        self.transaction_manager = TransactionManager()
    
    def execute_data_operation(self, operation):
        # Manage database connections
        # Optimize query execution
        # Handle transactions and consistency
        # Return operation results
        pass
```

#### Connection Manager

Manages database connections efficiently:

```python
class ConnectionManager:
    def __init__(self):
        self.connection_pools = {}
        self.health_monitor = HealthMonitor()
    
    def get_connection(self, backend):
        # Retrieve connection from pool
        # Create new connection if needed
        # Monitor connection health
        # Handle connection failures
        pass
```

### Data Operations Pipeline

1. **Request Processing**: Parse and validate data requests
2. **Connection Management**: Obtain appropriate database connections
3. **Query Optimization**: Optimize data access patterns
4. **Execution**: Execute data operations
5. **Caching**: Store results for future access
6. **Result Formatting**: Structure data for consumption
7. **Error Handling**: Manage operation failures

## Configuration

The service is configured through a JSON configuration file:

```json
{
    "backends": {
        "primary": {
            "type": "postgresql",
            "connection_string": "postgresql://user:pass@localhost/ravana",
            "pool_size": 10,
            "timeout": 30
        },
        "cache": {
            "type": "redis",
            "host": "localhost",
            "port": 6379,
            "ttl": 3600
        }
    },
    "optimization": {
        "query_cache_enabled": true,
        "connection_pooling": true,
        "retry_attempts": 3,
        "batch_processing": true
    },
    "consistency": {
        "transaction_isolation": "read_committed",
        "deadlock_retry": true,
        "consistency_checks": true
    }
}
```
