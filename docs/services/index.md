# RAVANA AGI Services

Services in RAVANA AGI provide shared functionality that can be accessed by multiple modules. They implement a service-oriented architecture pattern that promotes reusability and separation of concerns.

## Service Overview

### Data Service

The Data Service provides standardized access to various data sources and storage mechanisms.

Key Features:
- Unified data access interface
- Multiple storage backend support
- Data transformation capabilities
- Query optimization

[Detailed Documentation](data_service.md)

### Knowledge Service

The Knowledge Service manages structured knowledge representation and retrieval.

Key Features:
- Ontology management
- Knowledge graph construction
- Semantic search capabilities
- Knowledge validation

[Detailed Documentation](knowledge_service.md)

### Memory Service

The Memory Service provides a unified interface to both episodic and semantic memory systems.

Key Features:
- Dual memory system access
- Memory consolidation
- Context-aware retrieval
- Memory lifecycle management

[Detailed Documentation](memory_service.md)

### Multi-modal Service

The Multi-modal Service handles processing and integration of multiple data types.

Key Features:
- Image, text, and audio processing
- Cross-modal data integration
- Multi-modal analysis
- Media storage and retrieval

[Detailed Documentation](multi_modal_service.md)

## Service Architecture

### Service Interface Standards

All services implement a common interface pattern:

```python
class BaseService:
    def __init__(self, config):
        self.config = config
        self.initialized = False
    
    def initialize(self):
        # Service initialization logic
        pass
    
    def shutdown(self):
        # Cleanup and shutdown logic
        pass
    
    def health_check(self):
        # Service health status
        pass
```

### Service Registry

Services are registered in a central registry:

- Service discovery mechanism
- Dependency management
- Lifecycle coordination
- Version management

### Communication Patterns

Services communicate through several patterns:

1. **Direct Method Calls**: Synchronous service invocation
2. **Event Publishing**: Asynchronous communication through events
3. **Message Queues**: Decoupled communication for complex workflows
4. **Shared Memory**: High-performance data sharing for co-located services

## Service Implementation Guidelines

### Initialization and Configuration

Services should:
- Support configuration through standardized mechanisms
- Implement lazy initialization where appropriate
- Provide health check capabilities
- Handle configuration changes gracefully

### Error Handling

Services must:
- Implement comprehensive error handling
- Provide meaningful error messages
- Support graceful degradation
- Log errors for diagnostic purposes

### Performance Considerations

Services should:
- Optimize resource usage
- Implement caching where beneficial
- Support concurrent access
- Monitor performance metrics

### Security

Services must:
- Validate input data
- Implement access controls
- Protect sensitive information
- Audit security-relevant operations

## Service Integration

### With Modules

Services integrate with modules through:
- Dependency injection
- Configuration files
- Standardized APIs
- Event subscriptions

### With Core System

Services connect to the core system through:
- System event bus
- Shared state management
- Configuration management
- Lifecycle coordination

## Monitoring and Management

### Health Monitoring

Services provide:
- Health status indicators
- Performance metrics
- Resource utilization data
- Error rate tracking

### Management Interface

Services support:
- Remote management operations
- Configuration updates
- Performance tuning
- Diagnostic functions

## Future Development

Planned service enhancements include:
- Microservice architecture migration
- Containerization support
- Enhanced security features
- Improved scalability mechanisms
