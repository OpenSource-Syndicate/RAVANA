# Memory Service

## Overview

The Memory Service provides a unified interface to both episodic and semantic memory systems within RAVANA AGI. This service enables consistent memory operations across the system, supporting storage, retrieval, consolidation, and management of experiences and knowledge.

## Key Features

- Dual memory system access (episodic and semantic)
- Memory consolidation and integration
- Context-aware retrieval mechanisms
- Memory lifecycle management
- Performance optimization for memory operations

## Architecture

### Memory Manager

The core component that orchestrates memory operations:

```python
class MemoryManager:
    def __init__(self, config):
        self.config = config
        self.episodic_interface = EpisodicInterface()
        self.semantic_interface = SemanticInterface()
    
    def store_memory(self, memory_data):
        # Determine appropriate memory system
        # Store memory with proper metadata
        # Update memory indices
        pass
```

### Memory Interfaces

Specialized interfaces for different memory systems:

- Episodic Memory Interface: Handles personal experiences and events
- Semantic Memory Interface: Manages general knowledge and concepts
- Working Memory Interface: Manages temporary information storage

### Consolidation Engine

Manages memory integration and optimization:

- Memory consolidation processes
- Knowledge transfer between memory systems
- Redundancy elimination
- Memory compression and optimization

## Implementation Details

### Core Components

#### Memory Service Engine

Main memory service component:

```python
class MemoryServiceEngine:
    def __init__(self):
        self.storage_manager = StorageManager()
        self.retrieval_engine = RetrievalEngine()
        self.consolidation_manager = ConsolidationManager()
    
    def execute_memory_operation(self, operation):
        # Route operation to appropriate memory system
        # Manage storage and retrieval processes
        # Handle memory consolidation
        # Return operation results
        pass
```

#### Retrieval Engine

Manages memory search and retrieval:

```python
class RetrievalEngine:
    def __init__(self):
        self.episodic_retriever = EpisodicRetriever()
        self.semantic_retriever = SemanticRetriever()
        self.context_analyzer = ContextAnalyzer()
    
    def retrieve_memories(self, query):
        # Analyze retrieval context
        # Search appropriate memory systems
        # Rank and filter results
        # Return relevant memories
        pass
```

### Memory Operations Pipeline

1. **Request Processing**: Parse and validate memory requests
2. **System Routing**: Determine appropriate memory system
3. **Storage/Retrieval**: Execute memory operations
4. **Context Analysis**: Apply contextual filtering
5. **Result Processing**: Structure and format results
6. **Consolidation**: Trigger consolidation when needed
7. **Response Generation**: Create final memory response

## Configuration

The service is configured through a JSON configuration file:

```json

        },
        "semantic": {
            "backend": "neo4j",
            "connection_string": "bolt://localhost:7687",
            "ontology": "ravana_core"
        }
    },
    "retrieval": {
