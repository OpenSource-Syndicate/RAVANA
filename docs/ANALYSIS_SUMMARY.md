# RAVANA AGI System Cleanup and Standardization

## Completed Tasks

1. **Configuration Simplification**: Created a standardized configuration system in `core/standard_config.py` that provides a cleaner, more organized approach to configuration, though the main system still uses the original configuration for compatibility with existing functionality.

2. **Module Merging**: Created a merged experimentation module in `modules/experimentation.py` that combines features from both the standard and enhanced experimentation modules, preserving the conversational insight generation capability.

3. **Analysis Environment**: Created an `analysis/` directory with proper structure for conducting experimental work:
   - `experiments/` - Experimental code and scripts
   - `data/` - Datasets and input files
   - `results/` - Output and results from experiments
   - `models/` - Trained models and checkpoints
   - `notebooks/` - Jupyter notebooks for analysis
   - `logs/` - Log files from experimental runs

4. **Codebase Cleanup**:
   - Removed the old `enhanced_experimentation_module.py` since its features were merged
   - Removed the old `experimentation_module.py` since we now use the merged version
   - Created experiment templates for easier experimental work

## Directory Structure

├── README.md            # Analysis directory documentation
├── setup.py             # Setup script for analysis environment
├── experiments/         # Experimental code and scripts
│   ├── template.py      # Template for new experiments
│   └── template_fixed.py # Fixed version of template
├── data/                # Datasets and input files
├── results/             # Output and results from experiments
├── models/              # Trained models and checkpoints

└── logs/                # Log files from experimental runs
```

## Usage

To run experiments:

1. Create a new experiment script in the `analysis/experiments/` directory
2. Place any required data in the `analysis/data/` directory
3. Run your experiment script
4. Results will be automatically saved to the `analysis/results/` directory

The `analysis/experiments/template.py` file provides a starting point for new experiments.

## Key Changes

- The `modules/experimentation.py` file now includes both standard experimentation features and the enhanced conversational hypothesis generation
- The system maintains compatibility with the original configuration system while having a simplified configuration option available
- The analysis directory provides a dedicated space for experimental work without interfering with the main system
