**Causes**: 
- `BLOG_AUTO_PUBLISH_ENABLED=false`
- Importance threshold too high
- Frequency limiting active

**Solutions**:
```bash
# Check configuration
echo $BLOG_AUTO_PUBLISH_ENABLED
echo $BLOG_MIN_IMPORTANCE_THRESHOLD

# Lower threshold temporarily
export BLOG_MIN_IMPORTANCE_THRESHOLD=0.4

# Check last post time
python -c "
from core.services.autonomous_blog_scheduler import AutonomousBlogScheduler
scheduler = AutonomousBlogScheduler()
print(f'Last post: {scheduler.last_post_time}')
print(f'Status: {scheduler.get_status()}')
"
```

#### 2. Content Generation Failures

**Symptoms**: Blog triggers fire but content generation fails
**Causes**:
- LLM connection issues
- Content validation failures
- Template processing errors

**Solutions**:
```bash
# Test content generator directly
python -c "
import asyncio
from core.services.autonomous_learning_blog_generator import AutonomousLearningBlogGenerator

async def test():
    generator = AutonomousLearningBlogGenerator()
    title, content, tags = await generator.generate_learning_blog_post(
        trigger_type='curiosity_discovery',
        topic='Test Topic',
        learning_content='Test content',
        reasoning_why='Test why',
        reasoning_how='Test how',
        context='Test context',
        metadata={}
    )
    print(f'Generated: {title}')

asyncio.run(test())
"
```

#### 3. High Memory Usage

**Symptoms**: Increasing memory usage over time
**Causes**:
- Event queue not being cleaned
- Large content in metadata

**Solutions**:
```bash
# Manual cleanup
python -c "
from core.services.autonomous_blog_scheduler import AutonomousBlogScheduler
scheduler = AutonomousBlogScheduler()
scheduler.clear_old_events(hours=24)
print('Cleanup completed')
"
```

### Debug Mode
