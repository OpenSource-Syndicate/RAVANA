## How to Use

### Quick Start

```bash
# Run all tests with comprehensive reporting
python run_comprehensive_tests.py

# Run specific test categories
pytest tests/ -m unit          # Fast unit tests
pytest tests/ -m integration   # Integration tests  
pytest tests/ -m e2e           # End-to-end tests

# Run with coverage report
pytest tests/ --cov=core --cov=services --cov=modules --cov-report=html
```
