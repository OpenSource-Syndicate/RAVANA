Formulate a clear hypothesis to test\n2. Design rigorous experimental methodology\n3. Identify required materials and setup\n4. Specify measurement and data collection methods\n5. Define success criteria and validation methods\n6. Analyze potential failure modes and mitigations\n\n[REASONING FRAMEWORK]\nApply scientific method principles:\n1. Ensure hypothesis is falsifiable and specific\n2. Design controls to isolate variables\n3. Plan for replication and verification\n4. Consider alternative explanations\n5. Account for measurement uncertainty\n6. Plan for iterative refinement\n\n[OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS]\nProvide a complete experimental design with:\n- Experiment design: Complete experimental procedure\n- Expected outcomes: Predicted results with rationale\n- Resource requirements: List of needed materials and tools\n- Safety considerations: Risk assessment and safety measures\n- Validation approach: Method for verifying results\n- Failure analysis: Potential failure modes and mitigations\n\n[SAFETY CONSTRAINTS]\n- Adhere to all safety protocols and guidelines\n- Identify and mitigate potential hazards\n- Ensure environmental and ethical compliance\n- Plan for safe termination of problematic experiments\n",
