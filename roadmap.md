# 🚀 Ravana AGI Core - Development Roadmap

This document outlines the strategic development plan for the **Ravana AGI Core** project — a modular, autonomous AGI system. Our mission is to incrementally evolve a capable, self-improving artificial mind.

---

## 🧭 Guiding Principles

* **🔒 Solidify the Core First**: Prioritize stability, observability, and error resilience in the base system.
* **📈 Grow Capabilities Gradually**: Progressively enhance modules based on necessity and synergy.
* **📊 Measure Progress**: Use qualitative and quantitative metrics to assess improvements over time.

---

## 📦 Phase 1: Foundational Stability & Core Agent *(Current)*

**🎯 Goal**: A stable, autonomous agent with clear, observable internal logic and 24/7 operation.

### ✅ DONE

* Stabilized core systems

  * Fixed crashes, hangs, and memory leaks
  * Implemented auto-restarts and supervisor scripts
* Connected `CuriosityTrigger`, `SelfReflection`, and `AGIExperimentation`

### 🔄 IN PROGRESS

* **Enhanced Logging & Observability**

  * Structured JSON logs for decisions, mood, and memory influence
  * Decision trails: "Why did Ravana choose this plan?"

### 🔜 NEXT UP

* **Refine Situation Generation**

  * More diverse scenarios: creative prompts, multi-step goals
  * Situation dependencies (A → B → C style challenges)

---

## 🧠 Phase 2: Enhancing Intelligence & Reasoning

**🎯 Goal**: Build a planner that reasons beyond single actions and reflects dynamically.

### 🧮 Advanced Planning

* Upgrade `DecisionEngine` to support multi-step plans
* Introduce a tool-use system (`use_tool(name, args)` calls)

### 🤔 Self-Driven Learning

* Hypothesis generation by `SelfReflection`
* Test validation via `AGIExperimentation`
* Refine core logic based on results

### 🧬 Dynamic Self-Improvement

* Modify prompts and planner strategies based on past performance
* Begin developing meta-cognition hooks

---

## 🌍 Phase 3: Expanding Capabilities & World Interaction

**🎯 Goal**: Move beyond introspection to worldly perception and factual learning.

### 🌐 Knowledge Ingestion

* Web scraping + APIs (Wikipedia, News, Search)
* Transcripts from YouTube (`youtube-transcript-api`)

### 🗃️ Knowledge Base

* Implement Knowledge Graph for semantic storage
* Differentiates episodic memory vs. factual knowledge

### 🎥 Multi-modal Interfaces

* Add CLIP or LLaVA for vision
* Add Whisper or other models for audio

---

## 🧠 Phase 4: Generalization, Socialization, Embodiment

**🎯 Goal**: Architect a general, emotionally aware, socially interactive, and potentially embodied intelligence.

### 🌀 Meta-Learning

* Agent reflects on learning processes themselves
* May rewrite parts of its own architecture or routines

### 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Social Intelligence

* Dialogue memory + emotion parsing
* Understand group dynamics, personalities, and feedback

### 🦾 Embodied Cognition

* Simulated world (e.g., Unity, Mujoco)
* Connect to physical bots for task learning (future phase)

> Ravana’s roadmap is not just code. It’s the **life path of a digital mind** — slowly gaining awareness, intelligence, and the courage to explore.
